# Models - Source Code
The file links below will display source code, outputs, and reports for each of the Public School example models in any web browser.  You may also download the files and modify / run them using Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, and iPython Notebook.  Each file link contains detailed documentation on the code and transformations used to create a particular set of models.

Feature importance analysis is also performed to determined the most important model attributes. 
* [**2014SegregatedElementarySchoolCampuses.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2014/Models/2014SegregatedElementarySchoolCampuses.ipynb) - Python code to create and validate classification models for predicting highly minority segregated public school campuses.  Feature importance analysis is also performed to determined the most important model attributes.
* [**2014SegregatedHighSchoolCampuses.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2014/Models/2014SegregatedHighSchoolCampuses.ipynb) - Python code to create and validate classification models for predicting highly minority segregated public school campuses.  Feature importance analysis is also performed to determined the most important model attributes.
* [**2014SegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2014/Models/2014SegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb) - Python code to create and validate classification models for predicting highly minority segregated public school campuses.  Feature importance analysis is also performed to determined the most important model attributes.
* [**2014ComparingSegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2014/Models/2014ComparingSegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb) - Python code to create and validate classification models for comparing highly minority and majority segregated (>= 80%) public school campuses.  Feature importance analysis is also performed to determine the most important model attributes.  Multiple visualizations highlight the differences between majority and minority segregated schools.
* [**2014ComparingSegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb**](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakemdrew/EducationDataNC/blob/master/2014/Models/2014ComparingSegregatedMiddleSchoolCampuses.ipynb) - Python code to create and validate classification models for comparing highly minority and majority segregated (>= 80%) public school campuses.
