    "* **School Year** - This report covers the 2016-17 school year.  Data for 2017-18 should be available from NCDPI around 02/2019. \n",
    "* **Low Income** - This report measures low income using the percentage of economically disadvantaged students at each public school campus.\n",
    "* **Top Performing** - Public school campuses are sorted in descending order by School Performance Grade.  We also include each school's EVAAS Growth Score as well.  Each list may be resorted by EVAAS Growth Score to identify \"most improved\" campuses as well.\n",
